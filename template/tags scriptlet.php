##This scriptlet is an example of how tags will be handled in Wellspring


##Bunch of debug, proof of concept stuff

//Load the tag VARCHAR entry in the database, selected by song_id

//Explode the string by ", " and assign to a tag$songid array

//assign each of those tags a pass to the
//wellspring.com/tags/blue-red-or-something-like-tumblr that puts each of the
//links to a separate, dynamic webpage

##Hint: foreach tag as key => value
?>
