      <h5>Reflection</h5> <p>So it started with wanting to play a
      soccer game with some of the junior youth that we saw as we
      drove through Washington Park. We planned to go and meet the
      junior youth, then "play it by ear" as we saw the conversations
      and interactions progressed.
      We walked up and around the corner to see a group of junior youth, five or six
      boys, two girls, and assorted children just hanging around, waiting for
      something to happen. We talked to them a bit, asked how they were doing, etc.,
      and proposed that we played a quick game of soccer in the apartment complex - it
      ended up happening in the field behind them. We started to number off for teams,
      but ran into some troubles when some of the junior youth started to re-arrange
      themselves to be on the same team as their friends. After some talk about
      ensuring that the teams were balanced, and that random numbering helped to
      include everyone in the game without bias towards gender or skill, the junior
      youth abided by the numbering system and started to arrange themselves into
      their teams. We began playing soccer together, and all of the junior youth were
      working quite well together, and we were all having a good time. After a while,
      one of the junior youth remarked that he had lost some money, and we agreed to
      pause play until we found the money. Some time passed, and none of us found the
      money, so one or two of the team members got together with the junior youth and
      asked, "How are we going to get [the junior youth]'s money back?" Someone
      answered to clean up the complex, and see if the managers would be willing to
      pay them the sum that the junior youth had lost in exchange for cleaner
      apartments. We asked for some bags, and some places to begin picking up trash,
      and we set out in smaller teams across the complex, all the while attracting a
      few more junior youth to what we were doing. They were waiting for something to
      do. </p>
