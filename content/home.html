                <h4>Personal Reflections 11.20.2013</h4>
                <span>Post-date: 10-2-23 4:20 PM</span>
                <p>Pretty thoughts or something. </br></br>
                PERSONAL REFLECTIONS 11.20.2013</br>
                
                Okay, another day. Got to catch up a little bit on my sleep debt, rest a bit.
                Beat myself up about everything. Walked to the apartment, cleaned and cooked a
                bit. Heavy cream really needs milk with all of the fat; none of this half fat
                junk. The density of melted butter will exceed any other milk and separate to
                the top.</br></br>
                
                Shokouh asked me a bit about how I was feeling, I shared 'Sorry' with her. The
                depression is a little more real, but now I can acknowledge it and get over it a
                bit. Keep fighting, work within my limits. My trumpet chops got better, more
                like talking and speaking. Less frustrations. Got asked if I could choose to
                serve in Beaverton over Kent, I would. Although I felt it defeated the purpose
                of the spirit of service, but on the other side, it is important to serve where
                you can be joyful and be the most effective. So that is becoming more of an
                option.</br></br>
                
                Actually, more about that. "Want to cry want to hide/ Want to leave on a lie" is
                starting to become more of a considered option; leaving Kent, or serving to some
                other capacity. Outreach is not my bag, and I was starting to associate service
                with outreach, which was causing me to not want to serve past this year. That
                would be a no bueno option. Spiritual suicide.</br></br>
                
                Can't wait to get back home, talk with family, friends, Grace. About everything,
                about music, about life in general. But I shouldn't throw away this week; I can
                still be useful the days leading up to that.
